# Changelog

English | [中文](./CHANGELOG.zh.md)

## 1.118.0 - 2026-05-21

### Features
- `codex-imagegen`: new image-generation backend for non-Codex runtimes (e.g., Claude Code) — spawns `codex exec --json --sandbox danger-full-access` and delegates to Codex CLI's built-in `image_gen` tool, so no `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required. Ships with idempotency cache, file-lock concurrency control, JSONL event-stream parsing, PNG magic-byte validation, and exponential-backoff retries (by @yelban, #158)
- `baoyu-cover-image`: wire `SKILL.md` to call the `codex-imagegen` wrapper when `preferred_image_backend: codex-imagegen` is set, with `--timeout` documented for slow networks

### Refactor
- `codex-imagegen`: enforce `--prompt` / `--prompt-file` mutual exclusion in code (was docs-only)
- `codex-imagegen`: replace `(opts as any).__promptFile` hack with a typed `promptFile` field on `CliOptions`
- `codex-imagegen`: replace inline `cp|mv ... generated_images` regex with the shared `findCpToTarget` helper
- `codex-imagegen`: propagate `attempts` on error responses (previously hardcoded to `0`)
- `codex-imagegen`: drop dead `parseFinalJson()` + matching test (wrapper ignores agent-reported JSON in favor of disk verification)

### Security
- `codex-imagegen`: reject `--image` / `--ref` paths containing shell metacharacters before interpolating them into the agent instruction sent to `codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access`

### Credits
- `codex-imagegen` backend contributed by @yelban (#158)

## 1.117.2 - 2026-05-17

### Documentation
- `baoyu-cover-image`: ban programmatic text repair on generated bitmaps — disallow ImageMagick / Pillow / Canvas / SVG / HTML overlays to cover, rewrite, or replace title/subtitle text; regenerate from a corrected prompt or switch to a lower-text or no-title variant instead
- `baoyu-article-illustrator`, `baoyu-comic`, `baoyu-image-cards`, `baoyu-xhs-images`, `baoyu-infographic`, `baoyu-slide-deck`: sync the same text-repair ban with skill-specific text categories (labels/captions, dialogue/sound effects, titles/body/tags, headings/data values, slide titles/bullets)

### Features
- `baoyu-post-to-wechat`: send WeChat login QR code to Telegram when `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` env vars are set, enabling headless / remote login flows (by @beforesun)

### Refactor
- `baoyu-post-to-wechat`: harden Telegram QR notification — add 10s fetch timeout, defer the 2s QR-render wait until env vars are configured, and use viewport screenshot as fallback

## 1.116.4 - 2026-05-14

### Refactor
- `baoyu-wechat-summary`: streamline roast version prompts in output-formats.md (99 → 23 lines), add roast-specific profile usage bullets to SKILL.md Round 2

## 1.116.3 - 2026-05-13

### Documentation

## 1.116.0 - 2026-05-13

### Features
- Add `baoyu-wechat-summary` skill: summarize WeChat group chat highlights into structured digests with topic extraction, message leaderboards, and per-user profiles. Supports normal and roast (毒舌) versions, incremental mode, and profile backfill. Requires [wx-cli](https://github.com/jackwener/wx-cli).

## 1.115.4 - 2026-05-11

### Documentation
- Image generation backend selection: emphasize Codex `imagegen` as the priority runtime-native tool (invoke via the `Skill` tool with `skill: "imagegen"`) and forbid SVG/HTML/canvas substitution when no raster backend can be resolved — fall through to asking the user instead of silently emitting code-based art. Updated in `docs/image-generation-tools.md` and inlined into `baoyu-article-illustrator`, `baoyu-comic`, `baoyu-cover-image`, `baoyu-image-cards`, `baoyu-infographic`, `baoyu-slide-deck`, and `baoyu-xhs-images`.

## 1.115.3 - 2026-05-11

### Fixes
- `baoyu-post-to-wechat`: ensure tab activation before copy/paste in WeChat editor (by @fengxiaodong28)
- `baoyu-post-to-x`: use toolbar media upload instead of image clipboard paste for X Articles

## 1.115.2 - 2026-05-10

### Fixes
- `baoyu-post-to-x`: honor explicit Codex Chrome plugin requests as a distinct browser-control mode, keep Chrome Computer Use and CDP fallbacks from silently taking over, and improve X Articles draft creation detection.

## 1.115.1 - 2026-05-10

### Fixes
- `baoyu-imagine`: change the default MiniMax image API endpoint to `https://api.minimaxi.com` to match the current official image generation documentation, while keeping `https://api.minimax.io` available through `MINIMAX_BASE_URL` overrides.
- `baoyu-image-gen`: sync the deprecated image-generation entrypoint with the same MiniMax default endpoint and regression coverage.

## 1.115.0 - 2026-05-09

### Features
- `baoyu-post-to-x`: add Chrome Computer Use as the preferred execution mode in Codex. When Computer Use tools are available, all X UI actions (compose, article, quote, video) go through the user's real Chrome window instead of CDP scripts. CDP scripts become a fallback when Computer Use is unavailable or explicitly not requested.

## 1.114.1 - 2026-05-08

### Fixes
- `baoyu-danger-gemini-web`: restore generated-image extraction for current Gemini Web responses where image URLs appear as `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gg-dl/` without the legacy generated-image markers. Adds regression coverage for the fallback response shape. (by @evilstar2016)

## 1.114.0 - 2026-05-05

### Features
- `baoyu-infographic`: add `retro-popup-pop` style — retro pixel popup × pop-art collage. Renders content as a stack of 80/90s desktop popup windows (title bars, close buttons, ERROR / ALERT dialogs, file windows like `PROBLEMS.EXE`, progress bars, OK / CANCEL / FIX IT buttons) with thick black outlines, flat color fills, and bright cyan (#12B8DE) or vintage cream (#F5F0E6) backgrounds. Pairs especially well with the `dense-modules` layout; promoted as a recommended style for the `高密度信息大图` keyword shortcut and the `Product/Buying Guide` content type. Style Gallery count goes from 21 to 22.

### Documentation
- `release-skills`: document GitHub Release publishing in the release workflow, including release-notes extraction from changelog sections, annotated tag creation, `gh release create/edit`, and historical release backfill for existing tags.

## 1.113.0 - 2026-04-25

### Features
- `baoyu-imagine`: add DashScope Wan 2.7 image model support (`wan2.7-image-pro` and `wan2.7-image`) directly through the official Aliyun (Bailian) API. Supports text-to-image, image editing, and multi-image fusion with up to 9 reference images, with documented `[1:8, 8:1]` aspect ratio validation and per-mode pixel-budget rules. Forces `parameters.n: 1` to match baoyu-imagine's single-image save semantics and explicitly rejects `--n > 1` to prevent silent multi-image billing (the API defaults to `n=4` in non-collage mode). Allows `--provider dashscope --ref ...` opt-in for Wan 2.7 reference workflows.

## 1.112.0 - 2026-04-24

### Features
- `baoyu-article-illustrator`: make `hand-drawn-edu` (infographic + sketch-notes + macaron) the universal fallback preset when content analysis surfaces no strong signal — warm cream paper, black hand-drawn lines, soft pastel section blocks. Elevate `sketch-notes` to primary style across infographic / flowchart / comparison / framework auto-selection; rewrite the sketch-notes style spec (macaron palette, canonical single-page layout, diagram-only rule); add matching prompt block and workflow defaults.
- `baoyu-article-illustrator`: add `hand-drawn-edu-flow` (flowchart) and `hand-drawn-edu-compare` (comparison) presets for the same warm educational style.

### Breaking Changes
- `baoyu-article-illustrator`: `hand-drawn-edu` preset now maps to `infographic` instead of `flowchart`. Users relying on the previous flowchart behavior should switch to the new `hand-drawn-edu-flow` preset.

### Fixes
- `baoyu-post-to-x`: add entry point guard to `scripts/md-to-html.ts` so that importing `parseMarkdown` from `x-article.ts` no longer triggers the CLI entry point. Mirrors the same fix applied to `baoyu-post-to-weibo`.

## 1.111.1 - 2026-04-21

### Documentation
- Add a top-level `## Confirmation Policy` section to every image-generating skill (`baoyu-infographic`, `baoyu-cover-image`, `baoyu-slide-deck`, `baoyu-image-cards`, `baoyu-xhs-images`, `baoyu-article-illustrator`) as a single source of truth: explicit skill invocation, keyword shortcuts, EXTEND.md defaults, and auto-recommendations are recommendation inputs only — they never authorize skipping the confirmation step. Opt-out requires an explicit current-request signal (`--no-confirm` / `--quick` / `--yes` / "直接生成" / equivalent).
- `baoyu-infographic`: consolidate the scattered reminders (previously repeated across Step 5, Step 6, Default combination, Keyword Shortcuts, and the preferences docs) into a single policy section referenced from Step 4's hard gate.

## 1.111.0 - 2026-04-21

### Refactor
- Unify image-backend resolution across all image-consuming skills (`baoyu-infographic`, `baoyu-comic`, `baoyu-cover-image`, `baoyu-image-cards`, `baoyu-article-illustrator`, `baoyu-slide-deck`, `baoyu-xhs-images`): add a single `preferred_image_backend` preference field (`auto | ask | <backend-id>`) and replace the stateless ask-once rule with a 4-step resolution (current-request override → saved preference → auto-select → ask). Runtime-native tools (Codex `imagegen`, Hermes `image_generate`) are preferred by default; existing `EXTEND.md` files without the field are treated as `auto` with no schema bump.
- Add a top-level `## Changing Preferences` section to each image-consuming skill as a first-class surface for pinning the backend and editing common one-line preferences.

## 1.110.0 - 2026-04-21

### Features
- `baoyu-imagine`: add `gpt-image-2` support for OpenAI image generation and edits, make it the default OpenAI model, and document the official size/quality mapping, custom-size constraints, and Azure deployment guidance

## 1.109.0 - 2026-04-21

### Features
- `baoyu-url-to-markdown`: vendor the `baoyu-fetch` runtime into `scripts/lib` and run it through a local `scripts/baoyu-fetch` CLI so published skill installs are self-contained

### Fixes
- `baoyu-fetch`: extract playable X/Twitter video MP4 variants for single posts and X Articles, choosing the highest-bitrate MP4 and rendering article videos as `[video](...)`
- `sync-clawhub`: publish from the shared release file list so extensionless CLI entrypoints, `bun.lock`, and vendored `scripts/lib` files are uploaded

### Maintenance
- Upgrade `defuddle` to 0.17.0 and `jsdom` to 29.0.2; override `@xmldom/xmldom` to 0.8.13 to keep the Defuddle dependency chain vulnerability-free

## 1.105.0 - 2026-04-13

### Features
- `baoyu-diagram`: unify to analyze→confirm→generate workflow — remove single/multi mode split; skill now analyzes any input material, recommends diagram types and splitting strategy, confirms once, then generates all diagrams

## 1.101.0 - 2026-04-12

### Features
- `baoyu-imagine`: improve Replicate provider compatibility — route models through family-specific input builders and validators (nano-banana, Seedream 4.5, Seedream 5 Lite, Wan 2.7 Image); update default model to `google/nano-banana-2`; fix Seedream 4.5 custom size encoding to use width/height schema; fix aspect-ratio default inheritance for unsupported Replicate models; block multi-output requests before they reach the API (by @justnode)

## 1.100.0 - 2026-04-12

- `baoyu-danger-gemini-web`: adds `--sessionId` (local persisted sessions, plus `--list-sessions`) for multi-turn conversations and consistent multi-image generation.
- `baoyu-danger-gemini-web`: adds `--reference/--ref` for reference images (vision input), plus stronger timeout handling and cookie refresh recovery.
- Docs: `baoyu-xhs-images` / `baoyu-slide-deck` / `baoyu-comic` document session usage (reuse one `sessionId` per set) to improve visual consistency.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-01-16

- `baoyu-comic`: adds creation templates/references (character template, Ohmsha guide, outline template) to speed up “characters → storyboard → generation”.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-01-16

- Adds `baoyu-comic`: a knowledge-comic generator with `style × layout` and a full set of style/layout references for more stable output.
- `baoyu-xhs-images`: moves style/layout details into `references/styles/*` and `references/layouts/*`, and migrates the base prompt into `references/base-prompt.md` for easier maintenance/reuse.
- `baoyu-slide-deck` / `baoyu-cover-image`: similarly split base prompt and style references into `references/`, reducing SKILL.md complexity and making style expansion easier.
- Docs: updates `README.md` / `README.zh.md` skill list and examples.

## 0.4.2 - 2026-01-15

- `baoyu-danger-gemini-web`: updates description to clarify it as the image-generation backend for other skills (e.g. `cover-image`, `xhs-images`, `article-illustrator`).

## 0.4.1 - 2026-01-15

- `baoyu-post-to-x` / `baoyu-post-to-wechat`: adds `scripts/paste-from-clipboard.ts` to send a “real paste” keystroke (Cmd/Ctrl+V), avoiding sites ignoring CDP synthetic events.
